# Usofnem Registrar

Hello there üëèüèø! Welcome to my first repo with organization account. This repo is my first project on web3 and it just uses smartcontract without ipfs or anything.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop publication media with asset/content ownership in NFT. Content can be traded on the marketplace and advertisers can claim to place ads in that content.

Domain names in this context are assets, the more ownership of the domain name will give you more slots to publish content in it. Not only writing/blog content but if you are an artist you can also use a domain name to sell your artwork, whether it's a logo, meme or whatever.

## Trait for Domain Name

What is special about this domain name is the presence of several traits to identify the uniqueness. And these traits can be seen on the NFT Marketplace and make it easier for others to see the collection of each trait they like.

## Build with Nextjs

You can clone this DAPP and build new version with your own. clone this DAPP.

```
git clone https://github.com/usofnem/registrar-app.git

cd registrar-app

npm install

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

so you can clone and deploy new smartcontract for this DAPP, open `src/contract/Usofnem.sol`. Deploy with remix, hardhat or truffle whatever you want.

Update Contract address at `config.js` and contract ABI at `src/contract`. Save all and see the result on your local browser.
